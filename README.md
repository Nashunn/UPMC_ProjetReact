# UPMC_ProjetReact

## Introduction
---------------
The project is developped in React Native for the React Native course.
The goal was to developped an app of our choice using React. 

The project is made by :
- BOULLET Nicolas
- TRITTA Cl√©ment

## Principle
------------
The purpose of this application is to allow a user to have a personal note available, 
in which he can put all the information he wants to remember.

[![Home Screen]()]
[![Modification Screen]()]

## Difficulties
---------------
The first idea was to create an application that can allow the user to create multiple notes, accessible from the Home screen.
To deliver the project on time we made a version with only one note for the user, because we had trouble dealing with multiple data using asyncStorage.

We left the add note button to leave a trace of our work.

## Installation
---------------

To install the app, follow these instructions: 
```
git clone 

npm install 

npm start
(or) 
npm run android
```
